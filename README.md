# Introduction 
in this repository i write a simple convolutional nural network model using tensorflow and keras 📌📚 

In this repository, I have put a simple Convolutional neural network code for you to compare and find out how Convolutional neural network works and what happens when we use different activations functions .🛠️😁

so , let's look at the results 🤏😅

# Normal Convolutional neural networ model Example 🛠️📊

In this code i use cirfar10 dataset , cifar10 dataset has images with 32 by 32 bixels with 3 channels (RED GREEN BLUE) 🔴🟢🔵

It's not to bad 😁🤏


# Model predictions

red title means the prediction is not correct 🟢 but blue one means the prediction is correct 🔵

# Here is a convolutional neural network with activation func

### Relu

### Sigmoid

### Tanh

as you can see Relu is better than other activation functions 😃😅✍️🎈
