# Introduction 
in this repository i write a simple convolutional nural network model using tensorflow and keras 📌📚 

In this repository, I have put a simple Convolutional nural network code for you to compare and find out how Convolutional nural network works and what happens when we use different activations.🛠️😁

so , let's look at the results 🤏😅

# Model History 🛠️📊
